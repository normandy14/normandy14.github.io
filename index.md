I'm well-versed in computer science theory and software engineering fundamentals. I have 3 years in applied software development experience. I've built alot of software! I'm a proactive in keeping up with the latest software development trends.

### Cool Things I Do

I've built a way to connect to your favorite language learning mascot, Duo, that pesky bird from Duolingo. So now you can learn "café, con o sin azúcar?," without opening a web browser. Its built with my ol'reliable language, Python.

I like throwbacks like Pokemon and Digimon, so I took over an unmaintained project from 2015 and gave its codebase some love and its UI a makeover. I've also added some features. I also give myself some brownie points for using React; it's the rave in front development these days.
